    overview: `
ZycoSil+ is a reactive organosilane based waterproofing agent that seals up to nano-pore level.
It has the ability to penetrate deep inside the substrate and becomes a permanent integral
part of the structure.

It reacts and converts the hydrophilic chemical groups of the substrate into hydrophobic
groups. ZycoSil+ is water dilutable, safe, sprayable and easy to apply.

ZycoSil+ is non-leachable, UV resistant, breathable and does not present peel-off issues
unlike conventional polymer coatings.
